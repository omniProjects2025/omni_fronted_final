If the brain does not receive the appropriate amount of sleep, the brain will not function neurologically to its full capacity. The vital functions of cognition, such as attention, reasoning, problem solving, or decision making will be inhibited in the quality of neural functioning. So, we have cognitive processes that can relate directly to memory and memory consolidation and task performance, and of course cognitive performance, quality of cognition in things such as attention and decision making.",

While sleeping, a second important process occurs: a detoxification process becomes a second important cognitive process. During sleep, our body utilizes a waste byproduct system called the glymphatic system. This system, during sleep, clears waste products in the brain created by metabolism, including beta-amyloid. Beta-amyloid is increasingly and consistently being associated with cognitive decline, including <a><b>Alzheimer disease.</b></a> The two processes of sleep memory processing/memories and task performance, and the brain detoxification processes illustrate the significance that sleep as an operating function for the brain has. These insights highlight the impact of sleep on brain function, as well as the amazing role that sleep would play in the prevention of long-term cognitive decline and management of healthy cognitive processes.

Even at follow-ups longer than twenty years, researchers have reported that around 65 percent of people remain seizure-free. 70% of patients who had temporal lobe surgery become seizure-free, with 50% remaining seizure-free after ten years.",

For resection surgery or a hemispherectomy, between 50% and 85% of people may experience significant improvement in controlling seizures and, in some cases, become seizure-free. The success of epilepsy surgery depends on many factors, including the location of seizures in the brain and the safety of the procedure without affecting important brain functions."

Migraine is a common neurological issue that typically manifests as an intense headache coupled with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or an increased sensitivity to light and sound. It's essential to note that the specific symptoms can vary based on the type of migraine the patient has. This condition is caused due to a complex interplay of genetic factors. It is often triggered by certain biological and environmental influences.",
                "The triggers that cause for a migraine attack to occur may be unique to each individual and can comprise various stimuli, such as specific food components, odours, or hormonal fluctuations. An episode of the pain caused by a migraine is referred to as a ‘migraine attack’. It is an episode of intense pain, caused due to different triggers. A combination of medicine, along with behavioural measures and lifestyle changes, can be a highly effective way to deal with migraines and even prevent migraine attacks in the future."

Exercising regularly not only helps build muscle and bone strength, which provides protection for the joints, but it also promotes mobility and range of motion by preventing the muscles and joints from becoming stiff. Lack of movement and insufficient activity can lead to decreased mobility and stiffness in the joints and muscles, and may also result in joint pain.",

Exercising at home, accompanied by some proper stretching, can be extremely beneficial in preventing joint pain and stiffness not only during winters but also year-round."

The dry air can still cause the loss of moisture through the skin, leading to dehydration. Dehydration can result in decreased mobility due to reduced lubrication and joint fluid, while increasing sensitivity to pain and aches. This can also lead to muscle cramping. So, be sure to replenish water from time to time in any form. The best way to keep the body hydrated while also keeping it warm is to drink hot beverages and fluids such as hot tea, coffee, soups, and other such drinks."

For instance, if a person overstretches their back muscles during exercise, injures them, or lifts something heavy improperly, they may experience back pain.",

They will conduct necessary checks or tests to identify the source of the pain, preventing the potential worsening of the condition. Early resolution of problems is crucial, as is the case with many health concerns.",
                "<b>Radiating Pain from the Back:</b> If you’re dealing with severe back pain that radiates to other body parts, such as experiencing a sharp sensation down your leg, it’s important to seek medical attention. This could be indicative of sciatica, a pain condition affecting the sciatic nerve. Originating in the lower back, this nerve travels through the buttocks and extends down each leg. The common cause is herniated discs.",
                "<b>Unexplained Weight Loss:</b> Back pain coupled with unexplained weight loss might signal a more serious underlying condition. If you experience unexpected weight reduction that cannot be attributed to dietary or lifestyle changes, particularly if it coincides with back pain, caution is advised. Both weight loss and back pain can be symptoms of endocarditis, a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the heart’s inner lining. To rule out the possibility of a serious disease like an infection or tumor, it’s recommended to consult a doctor.",

However, if the patient’s fever does not respond to normal over-the-counter treatments, they likely have an acute condition that must be treated right away. The presence of an infection might be indicated by fever and back pain. Meningitis, spinal epidural abscess, and vertebral osteomyelitis are examples of spinal infections. Spinal infections need to be treated by a doctor very promptly.",
                "<b>Tingling, Weakness, or Numbness:</b> Back pain coupled with tingling, numbness, or weakness may be a symptom of injured or irritated nerves. This is particularly true if the pain does not go away after using over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers. If neglected, nerve pain can be severe and lead to inability or permanent damage. ",
                "<b>Urination or Bowel Difficulties:</b> It’s time to seek care right away at a nearby emergency department if a lack of control over the bowels or urine accompanies the back discomfort. These signs and symptoms suggest cauda equina syndrome, a condition in which the nerves in the lower spine are paralyzed. Despite being uncommon, if ignored, this disease can cause lifelong nerve damage. One may require surgery to decompress the nerves and retain their general function if they experience these symptoms, particularly if they are accompanied by numbness in the legs. Further potential reasons include an infection, a lesion or tumor in the spine, or a severe injury."

When this tension persists for several hours, complications may arise. Thus, it is important to rewire our neural system to change our ineffective movement patterns.

                "Known as the most mobile joint in the human body, the shoulder joint is characterized by a ball-and-socket mechanism where the head of the humerus bone fits into the glenoid cavity of the scapula. The shoulder's ball-and-socket structure allows it to rotate in multiple directions, making it highly mobile. Though it's attached to muscles, tendons, and ligaments, the shoulder can become unstable due to its mobility. As a result, the shoulder has the highest chance of dislocating out of all the joints in the body. For example, shoulder dislocation occurs when the upper arm bone has separated from the socket."

In addition to <a href=\"https://omnihospitals.in/bone-tumours-symptoms-treatment/o1-min-1/\">bone displacement</a>, shoulder dislocation cases can also involve tears in the ligaments or labrum within the shoulder joint.",
                "Shoulder dislocation can occur forward, backwards, or downward. Anterior shoulder dislocations are the most common type, which occur when an injury forces the arm to move forward or downward while being abducted from the body. This can result in the humerus bone sliding out of its socket in the front of the shoulder joint. The humeral head anterior dislocation causes the ball to exert intense upward pressure on the front glenoid labrum at the socket's front.",
                "A Hill-Sachs lesion often accompanies Bankart lesions, which involve damage to the anterior inferior part of the glenoid labral complex in the shoulder joint. A Hill-Sachs lesion is similar to a dent in your bone. The ball at the humerus top, which is located in the shoulder blade, may get harmed if your shoulder dislocates and is forced against the lip of the socket."

It is quite common as the focus of a person by time may shift or even be reduced which is directed toward a minor mistake leading to a mishap. Hence the first and foremost thing to keep in mind as a preventive measure is to play the sport with maximum focus. Focus is the key.",
                    "<b>Ample Warmup Before The Strenuous Sport</b> – Appropriate light exercises are mandatory before doing anything intensive as warm-up exercises help to loosen the muscles and also make the area near the joints more flexible at a gradual pace.",

Equipment such as face shields, guards, and so on save our body from damage to a great extent. That way maximum output can be expected with the least strain on the human body. Anything apart from the generic approach could lead to an injury.",

                    "<b>Right Way of Relaxing</b> – Once taking a break after playing a sport, the focus must be on the aspects of the body part on which maximum strain was faced. Eg- Muscle/ joint/ arm etc. Accordingly, extra care should be taken for that part for its faster recovery example by cold packs or gentle massage or not putting strain on that body part for the next few hours. This way even though there was no injury initially it drastically reduces the chances of developing an injury in the near future.",
                    "<b>Right Way of Starting</b> – As the extra focus is kept on the most strained body part during the break the same way that body part should be faced with strain at a decent pace.

During warm-up, the generic exercises are done whereas here specific exercise is done to focus on that part of the body that is vulnerable to maximum strain."

Complications of Metastatic Bone Disease (MBD) can affect the patient's quality of life, so making careful assessment and appropriate management of those patients is essential.",
                "The roles of orthopaedic and spinal surgeons in MBD generally fall into one of four categories: diagnosis, the prophylactic fixation of metastatic deposits at risk of impending fracture (preventative surgery), the reconstruction of bones affected through pathological fractures (reactive surgery), or the decompression and stabilisation of the vertebral column, spinal cord and nerve roots.",
                "Several key principles should be adhered to whenever operating on skeletal metastases. Discussions should be done early with an appropriate multi-disciplinary team before the intervention. A detailed pre-assessment is important to gauge a patient's suitability for the surgery – recovery from elective surgery should be shorter than the anticipated survival. Staging and biopsies provide prognostic information. Primary bone tumours should be ruled out in the case of a solitary bone lesion to avoid inappropriate intervention. Prophylactic surgical fixation of a lesion before a pathological fracture reduces the morbidity and length of hospital stay. Regardless of a lesion or pathological fracture's location, all regions of the affected bone must be addressed, to reduce the risk of subsequent fracture. Surgical implants should enable full weight bearing or return to function immediately. Post-operative radiation therapy should be utilised in all cases to minimise the progression of disease.",
                "Spinal surgery should be considered for those with spinal pain because of doubtless reversible spinal instability or neurological compromise. The opinion of a spinal surgeon should be sought as soon as possible, because delays in referral directly correlate to worse functional recovery following intervention. Patients who suffer a slowly progressive deficit, present within hours of complete neurological deficit, or have compression caused by bone alone are those most likely to benefit from surgery. Back pain in the presence of MBD should be regarded as impending spinal cord compression and investigated urgently to allow intervention prior to the development of neurological compromise."

If the cartilage is eroded, it is very much difficult to regrow the cartilage using medications. There is no medicine that helps in the growth of cartilage.<br>If it is the 1st or 2nd stage then, it is possible to reduce the joint pain through medication. But, if it is stage 3 and beyond then, it is not possible to regrow the cartilage. In general, the replacement surgery for a knee joint is performed for those whose age is above 55 or 60 years. Once the surgery is done, it enhances the functioning of the knee joint. The patient becomes pretty active and capable of walking without any support.<br>The hip replacement surgery is usually done for young patients. This particular surgery is done in a very rare case in old age patients. People suffering from hit joint pain cannot sit, climb stairs, squat, and cannot walk straight. If such patients don’t undergo hip replacement surgery, they can’t perform their daily activities as mentioned earlier. The more you delay the surgery, the more deformities happen in the hip joint or in the knee joint.<br>The doctor will suggest surgery only if you are fit for it. If the pain is affecting the functioning of the knee joint or hip joint then, the patient must and should go for a hip joint or knee joint replacement surgery.

Modern hip replacements are made of materials like titanium or high grade stainless steel and contain bearings such as ceramics, cobalt-chrome and highly cross-linked polyethylene that make them very durable. Age is not generally a concern when considering someone for a hip replacement as long as they have the right level of fitness and the operation is done for the right indication.

It may be performed for other knee diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. This is a well established procedure giving consistently good outcome with long term results often matching and sometimes exceeding those of total hip replacement. In general, the surgery consists of resurfacing the diseased or damaged joint surfaces of the knee with metal and plastic components shaped to allow continued motion of the knee. During the operation any deformities must be corrected, and the ligaments balanced so that the knee has a good range of movement and is stable. In some cases the articular surface of the patella is also removed and replaced by a polyethylene button. Functionally, most patients get back to their formal lifestyle including most non-impact leisure activities like golf."

There is no long stem placed down the femur so it is more like a natural hip and may allow patients a return to many activities. It seems the ideal option for young individuals with severe hip osteoarthritis who are likely to outlive any prosthesis that they receive and who are keen to carry on with an active lifestyle. In the unlikely event of the resurfacing failing many years down the line the bone stock that has been preserved in the first instance makes the revision in most cases almost as easy as doing a primary hip replacement. According to the Australian Registry data for 2009, performance of hip resurfacing for men under 65 years of age is better than total hip replacement."

Revising them is highly specialised surgery requiring extensive training and access to sophisticated equipment, implants and hospital facilities. In most cases the old prosthesis is removed and replaced with a new implant. The surgery is often long and the risk of complications is higher than after a primary operation. Patients tend to spend the first 24 to 48 hours after the procedure in the high dependency unit. Surgery may involve the use of ultrasonic devices to remove the old cement used for fixation of the prosthesis, bone graft and/or custom made implants. Identifying failing joint replacements and performing the revision early is crucial for a successful outcome and therefore a regular follow-up by an orthopaedic surgeon is advisable for all patients carrying a hip or a knee replacement."

                "<b>When is joint replacement surgery recommended?</b> Most patients with severe hip or knee pain as a result of advanced arthritis may be candidates for joint replacement. Joints can also get damaged due to previous injury or infection. Other indications include congenital disorders, childhood disorders leading to arthritis in later life, avascular necrosis etc.",
                "<b>How long do joint replacements last?</b> On average a hip or knee replacement has a 90% chance that it will survive 10 years and a 80% chance that that it will last 20 years if done by a well trained surgeon at a specialist hospital. The survival is highly dependent on the quality of surgery and the implant used.",
                "<b>What are they made of?</b> Modern joint replacements are made of many different materials – including Cobalt-Chrome alloy, surgical grade stainless steel, titanium. Your surgeon should be able to give you more information depending on what joint you are having replaced. All joint replacements done at Udai Clinic are imported at the moment.",
                "<b>How long will I need bed rest for?</b> You will almost never need any bed rest. The aim of the surgery is to get you out of bed as soon as possible after surgery. You will need intensive physiotherapy during the recovery phase of 6-8 weeks.",
                "<b>How long will I stay in the hospital?</b> On average a patient after joint replacement will stay between 5-7 days in the hospital. Following complex joint replacement, the stay may be longer.",
                "<b>Will I be able to sit on the floor?</b> Many patients can sit on the floor after joint replacement surgery whether it is the hip or the knee. However, your surgeon will guide you on this depending on what you are having done and the complexity of the surgery. Kneeling might be difficult after knee replacement surgery. Again, the quality of surgery is the key. If done well and if the patient is motivated, most activities of daily living are possible.",
                "<b>Can I ride a scooter or drive a car afterwards?</b> Most patients can start driving after about 6 weeks but please discuss this with your physiotherapist or your surgeon.",
                "<b>At what age is joint replacement recommended?</b> Joint replacement can be done at any age. Most patients are between 55 – 80 years of age but the range can be from teenage to over 90 years. As long as the patient is reasonably fit, joint replacement can be done. Your doctor should be able to advise on this."

Another common medical condition that causes coughing, wheezing, and pressure in the chest due to inflammation of the airways is asthma. Fever, coughing, and trouble breathing are signs of pneumonia, an infection that affects the lungs' air sacs. Furthermore, lung cancer, which is characterised by unrestrained cell development in the lungs, is an existential threat to public health. Lung cancer claims more lives than the combined diseases of the breast, colon, and prostate. Due to the detrimental effects on breathing, sleep disturbances are regarded as significant lung diseases.

The patient, Harikrishna, 32 years, was diagnosed as a case of coronary artery disease not amenable to angioplasty, hence referred for bypass surgery. Since he is a young man with lean built, a decision was made to perform minimal invasive bypass surgery. A muscle splitting, rib preserving incision was made on the left side of the chest and chest cavity was entered. The left internal mammary artery on the chest wall was harvested and bypass surgery was performed on the beating heart without heart-lung machine support. The patient withstood the procedure well and was fit to move around on the first post-operative day itself. He was discharged within 5 days of procedure and can return to work within ten days of surgery."

He worked at a hospital in Glasgow, Scotland, where he saw a lot of paediatric patients were treated for hernia and hairlip surgery and were discharged on the same day. After a decade i.e., around 1919, an anaesthetist namely Ralph Walter witnessed a tremendous response to daycare surgeries. He then planned to setup a daycare unit.

One of the factors behind the cause of ADHD is the reduction in dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical present in the brain that assists transfer signals between the nerves. This chemical plays a crucial role in causing emotional responses and movements in people. Some other researchers say that people with ADHD have less gray matter.

It restrains the hyperactivity and impulsivity in kids with ADHD. In just a few months, the kid will goes back to being normal after using this drug. Only children above the age of 6 are prescribed with this drug. If a kid has this problem at the age of 2-3 years, the only thing one can do is to cure through behavioral therapy. It’s the most commonly used drug for treating kids with ADHD. Dosage: The dosage of Methylphenidate medication starts with 0.3 milligrams for kids above 6 years. This medication should be given in the morning and at times when the child is active. The impact of this medication will remain 3 to 4 hours in the kid. There is no necessity to give this medication before sleep. Another popular medication is 'Atomoxetine' which is available everywhere. The major problem with methylphenidate is that it may not be available in all medical stores. The same age limit applies to Atomoxetine as well.

Their academic and extra-curricular performance in school is good. In this way, we can differentiate between ADHD kid and Hyperactive kid."

Numerous elements, such as the environment, mosquito behaviour, and human activity, might affect the spread of malaria. Since stagnant water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes, places with inadequate drainage and poor sanitation are especially conducive to spreading malaria. The location and quantity of mosquitoes that transmit malaria can also be impacted by urbanisation and climate change, which may raise the risk of transmission in some areas.",

If people in regions where malaria is endemic are not sufficiently protected against mosquito bites, they run a chance of catching the disease.",

Years of exposure can lead to the development of partial immunity, but a child's risk of mortality is highest when they have the infection for the first time. A child who is bitten by a malaria parasite-carrying mosquito frequently lacks access to the necessary medical care in low-income nations, and the child's parents might not even understand the full significance of the child's symptoms."

When these medications are taken consistently, the growth of malaria parasites can be inhibited, lowering the risk of infection.",

                "It’s referred to a serious increase in the number of cases that occurs after the original surge has been stopped in a particular area. Pandemics are mainly caused by the new pathogens that the vast majority of humans have no immune protection against. That’s what causes global outbreaks. After few months, it comes back and spreads around the world, or large parts of it, again.",
                "Most countries have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by restricting movement, which slows down the virus’s spread but leaves many people vulnerable to infection once they begin to go out again. But, different parts of the world have seen localised outbreaks weeks into their re-openings. They’re mainly linked to the resumed economic activity. Lifting containment measures too allows cases to start rising. Cold weather is a major factor which affects the coronavirus. The pathogen can mutate. Another important thing is the movement of the virus to populations that haven’t been exposed before and don’t have immunity. Testing, isolating and contact-tracing remain the main tools to stop a cluster from growing into a wave."

Second wave mainly depends on how well we all do at infection control measures, like distancing, mask-wearing and hand-washing. If everybody just had a mask then the transmission can be stopped. One simply cannot get infected with this virus unless you breathe it in, or you touch an infected surface and then touch your eyes, nose and mouth. Along with maintaining social distance and wearing a mask, the only other thing that will change or mitigate the severity of a second wait is when and if vaccines become available."

In order for the virus to survive in nature, it makes every attempt to change its genetic structure. If there is a minor change in the genetic structure (drift), people can be reinfected with mild symptoms & very low mortality (a small fraction of 1%). If the virus is lucky to get a major change in genetic structure, symptoms are likely to be more severe & mortality higher (a little more than 1%). In the second situation, nearly all people in the community will be affected over some time because they do not have the antibodies against the new virus.",

But in reality, there will be another 10-100 coronavirus cases for everyone tested positive cases, which are not tested because they are mild. Most of the deaths are from the aged group or having underlying diseases (diabetes, immunodeficiency, hypertension, etc). We should not look at coronavirus infection as a nuclear bomb killing everyone infected with it.",

Infections such as bacterial or viral infections or allergies can irritate the lining of these structures, leading to the filling of fluid in these structures. Thus, fluid cannot drain from the sinuses, causing blockage. This ultimately leads to pressure and pain in the face, along with nasal congestion and other symptoms. The fluid in the sinuses is produced to keep the nose clean and free from bacteria, viruses, allergens, or other pathogens that can potentially irritate the lining of the sinuses. Irritation in the sinuses causes blockage in the drainage system of the fluids, causing pressure to build up in these structures."

The eardrum is about the size of a dime and is the same size in the newborn baby as in the adult. The space inside the eardrum is called the middle ear. The medical term for all three bones together is the middle ear ossicles.",

The fluid wave stimulates the hair cells in the cochlea and an electrical impulse is sent through the eighth cranial nerve to the brain.",

They pick up speech and other sounds through tiny built-in microphones, make them louder, and play them into a child’s ears. Modern hearing aids are “digital.” This means that audiologists use computers to tell the digital chip inside of hearing aids how much loudness to add at different frequencies or pitches.",

We prepare for a puja with utmost dedication and concentration each and every time, I have a similar approach towards surgery as I would want the best outcome for each and every one of my patients. Thorough workup of the patient without missing any detail, discussing in detail with the patient and their family about the procedure intended and possible outcomes, and answering all their queries form a major part of my preparation.",

One more most important aspect of laparoscopic surgery is that it is completely about teamwork amongst well-trained assistants, theatre staff and the doctor. I am glad that over a period of these five years in OMNI, we have been able to develop a wonderful camaraderie with my team.",

Medically, she was advised surgery by the doctors she consulted prior to visiting us, we managed her medically and she came back pregnant the next year and delivered with us. I strongly believe that surgeons more than learning how to do the surgery should know when to operate and when not to operate. To exert this discretion is of utmost importance in my opinion.",
                "High-risk cases are extremely challenging to handle especially in obstetrics because we deal with two lives, the mother and the baby. To manage these cases. apart from strong academic and scientific knowledge, decision making at the appropriate time is vital as there is a very thin line between saving both the baby and mother and losing them. Sometimes we have to take a decision to lose the baby for mother’s sake through a painful decision. Handling these cases is extremely stressful as pregnancy is always a happy event which is looked forward to and things turning bad during pregnancy are not taken well by the family, so taking care of these volatile patients as well as their family takes quite a toll on us. But at the end of it when the patient recovers there can be no happier moment, and so we go on.”"

Amputation rates have decreased due to angioplasties. A minor balloon catheter is inserted through the arm or groin into an artery to improve blood flow to the limb. The balloon is inflated once it has been positioned near the blockage, creating more space in the narrowed artery. Stents, wire tubes that keep an artery open, may then be implanted by your physician. When you are aware of where you are on the PAD progression, you can determine the next steps.",

First and foremost, telehealth/telemedicine takes the danger of physical contact out of the equation. Secondly, it is fast – which can be a real heaven-sent for patients in critical cases or during times of emergency. With almost every person now owning a mobile, and with telecom companies gradually expanding the reach of their tower networks and bringing down cost of Plans, one can access critical medical attention – by the finest professionals around the world – from practically anywhere, such as remote villages and regions of the country where a majority of ‘Bharat’ lives. An active telemedicine channel also goes a long way to relieve the pressure from frontline and other hospital staff and keeps them protected, since there is less in-person interaction. Finally, with physical visits no longer essential, both costs and hassle of treatment are coming down. It’s a win-win situation, especially if one is a patient.",

By adopting appropriate digital formats and platforms, it is now possible to substitute laborious manual efforts and paper formats with just a few clicks of an electronic or digital device. Both patients and care providers like hospitals and professionals benefit greatly from this new system. That is because (A) it is more accurate - since there are fewer manual mistakes happening, (B) records are easier to store and organize - which makes the system more accurate and efficient, and (C) allows for fast retrieval, share-ability and access at the point of care - making it easy for the consulting doctor or attending professional to check patient history conveniently and quickly. No wonder ‘paperless’ EMR systems are now acting as a vital support points for doctors, professionals and institutions to take better clinical decisions (CDSS), and as a result, patients are receiving higher quality diagnosis and treatment."

Knowledge about COVID-19 is evolving at a rapid pace. This topic will discuss in brief about airway management and other infection control measures in anaesthesiology setting while dealing with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients with precautions recommended from Anaesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (ASPF) and American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA). These are hand hygiene and contact, droplet and airborne precautions."

Initially, the hernia will be an uncomplicated hernia, only coming up when the patient lies down and then disappearing. But gradually, in the next stage, the patient will push the contents of the hernia, or the hernial contents into the abdomen manually. Later on, it will never be pushed up so it gets stuck in that area. And finally one of the loops of the bowel will get stuck and that will lead to incarceration. So the bowel will have less blood supply and that may lead to gangrene of the bowel also. In that situation, the patient will be having severe abdominal pain and distention of the abdomen. The patient will have low urinary output, vomiting and other issues."

This forms a point of contact for many people and can become a potential fomite in spreading infections. To eliminate this, many companies have come up with many products that can dispense hand sanitiser without the need to touch the bottle. But the thing is they are ridiculously overpriced.",

What this product does is, it detects an object/hand near the nozzle using an INFRARED OBSTACLE SENSOR and relays this information to an ARDUINO NANO, which is a micro-controller (sort of BRAIN of the project) that then directs the submersible pump to switch on and dispense the hand sanitiser onto the hand. When the hand is removed the same sensor detects that and the ARDUINO now shuts off the pump automatically, thereby eliminating the need for someone to operate the bottle and to some extent removes a point of contact among people."

Countries like India are ripe candidates for disruption due to three main reasons: 1) An educated and technology aware critical population mass. 2) Economic imperative to shortcut and leapfrog the incremental growth process and 3) A reasonably well developed non risk averse entrepreneurial ecosystem.",

              "Healthcare has defied disruption forces for the simple reason that the key stakeholders (the doctors) are uniquely averse to change. As part of their professional training they are taught to take all new things with a huge pinch of salt, as it might hurt their patients.",

              "Without getting into the semantics of how they are different (I will call both as EMRs), this is an industry whose time has come. Earlier it was great technology which was however VERY EXPENSIVE. A million dollar (minimum) sticker price was a strict no-no for hospitals struggling to nudge their EBITDA into two digits. Besides, the desktop based interfaces were depriving the clinician from valuable eye contact time with his patients. Luckily Indian tech entrepreneurs have a fix now: a mobile based EMR, as powerful as the desktop based one, infinitely more usable by the doctors (its another app among the 100s that he/she already has on her phone) AND available on a very reasonable subscription fee.",
              "These EMRs will also have virtual ICU and patient portal functions enabling the doctor to view critical patient data remotely (and give treatment orders) and the patient to book his visit remotely and even conduct a doctor’s consultation, remotely via video conference and pay for ordered lab (with home sample collection) and ordered medications (with home delivery).",
              "Suddenly, the million dollar costs have evaporated and the EMR has become affordable, usable and converting the hospital/doctor interface closer to Amazon’s retailing experience. Through the patient portal, the patient carries on his smartphone his ICD coded clinical problem list, diagnostic results, images, medication lists, allergies and past discharge summaries. His whole healthcare experience gets simplified and the smartphone becomes the centre of his healthcare experience, like in retail. I see a huge spurt in adoption even by mid-tier hospitals and a spurt in providers of such technology. As adoption increases, over a few years Indian patient algorithms will be able to guide us into newer treatment paradigms and shorten the treatment evolution cycle from few decades to few years.",
              "I rest my case. This will begin re-imagining the chronic diseases management industry as soon as some business savvy investor releases hardware in India at Indian price points with huge volumes."

Even with 8-10 hours of sleep, they tend to feel fatigued.
