                "Published by: Indo- Asian-News-Service Ankit Shah, Chief Financial Officer, INCOR Healthcare INCOR Healthcare has successfully raised financing of INR 1550 million from Emerging India Credit Opportunities Fund I (EICOF I), an Investec managed SEBI registered Category II Alternate Investment Fund along with co-investment by Investec Bank PLC. INCOR Healthcare, which operates the Multi-speciality Hospital business under the brand name OMNI Hospitals was founded in the year 2010 with the aim of bringing affordable, accessible, and accountable healthcare within the reach of everyone. Over the years OMNI has grown into a dynamic multi-specialty hospital chain of 6 hospitals spread across Andhra Pradesh & Telangana. With over 30 specialties, 800+ beds, 20 OTs, 21 ICUs, 2000+ healthcare workers, OMNI is a leading multi-specialty hospital in South India in the segment it caters to. Functional for over 11 years, the hospital has been successful in creating a unique identity of its own as a professional medical care provider with a strong adherence to ethics and a clear focus on bettering the health and lifestyle of the community in which it operates in. The expansion plan for INCOR, under the brand OMNI Hospitals includes taking the bed count from 800+ to 1,500 – 2,000beds (based on investment availability) over the next 5-6 years. There will also be a geographic expansion, from current presence of 2 Indian states to 5 Indian states. INCOR will continue to exercise its expertise in acquiring and turning around sick hospitals into profitable centers. This growth will be supported and enabled with paperless technology environment support, and a patient engagement portal that will open up franchising opportunities enabling further growth. INCOR Healthcare also operates their Mother and Child hospitals– Under ‘GIGGLES’ brand, this brand has been designed to bring quality delivery, gynecology, pediatric, fertility and neonatal care to the masses. Targeting the lower middle class, this hospital chain provided hygienic, world class infrastructure at affordable costs. The focus of INCOR Group will continue to be providing affordable, accountable, accessible (AAA+ Care) healthcare to those who need it. It will continue to operate on its core philosophy of PATIENT FIRST, i.e., always putting the needs and requirements of the patient above it all and delivering quality care with love and compassion. The investments by Investec managed EICOF I and Investec Bank PLC reinforces the strength of INCOR’s healthcare business. EICOF I focuses on investing in and providing private debt financing solutions to mid-market companies with strong promoter pedigree, corporate governance and robust financial performance, amongst other things. Investec Bank PLC is a UK-based leading mid-market focussed international financial services company that has been underwriting mid-market private credit in India since 2013-14. OMNI Hospital’s Group Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Aloke Chandra Mullick said, “There is renewed interest and growth momentum in this sector over the past two years. We plan to grow our asset base and financials, so as to be ready for a public listing in three years.” OMNI Hospital’s Group Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Ankit Shah who was leading the transaction has said, “This transaction closure has been the fastest for any institutional investor backed investment in INCOR, with respect to closure timelines. The funding helps INCOR to firm up its consolidation strategy by giving an exit to its outgoing Private Equity investor, ASK Pravi. The consolidation also portrays conviction of the Promoter in its core philosophy in Healthcare and the growth strategy.” About INCOR Group INCOR began its journey in 2006, recognizing a huge need gap in the way real estate was being approached in India. The vision paid returns almost immediately, attracting a partnership with two well-known Israeli companies – Property and Building Corporation (PBC) and Electra Real Estate (ERE) – resulting in the formation of PBEL Property Development (India) Pvt Ltd. Over the years INCOR has expanded its presence in Telangana, Andhra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and has developed over 40million sqft and has 30million sqft under development, including commercial and residential projects. INCOR began its foray into healthcare with OMNI Hospitals in the year 2010. OMNI has grown to a chain of 6 hospitals operational across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. In the last few years, INCOR has diversified its presence by incubating multiple startups in hospitality, wealth management and mental health. INCOR’s businesses have been formed on three pillars: accessibility, affordability and accountability. We strive to ensure every citizen has access to good housing and healthcare, that he/she is able to afford. Accountability of great outcomes lies with us and is monitored closely."

                        "The need for clinical analytics is only going to expand not only as healthcare organisations gain the ability to uncover more sophisticated analytics, but this is going to be driven by the steep and rapid increase in available clinical data and an imperative to improve the clinical outcomes. Clinical analytics is poised to become an essential tool that makes use of real-time medical data to generate insights, take decisions, predict outcomes and decrease costs by enabling early interventions for potential clinical complications. It will lead continuous improving of quality of care, faster development of better treatment protocols and improvement in human health on population scales.",
                        "One aspect of this is the increasing use of data enabled evidence-based solutions across the organisations. The patient care is a continuously evolving process and the availability of continuous increasing data sets should produce information that will allow to adopt and enhance for better patient care. This is true in the provider aspect, where healthcare providers can ensure that they are prescribing the best treatment for patients with certain problem & symptom, diseases or conditions. The use case also exist both for insurance company and healthcare providers to examine more population-based data, to compare and contrast the treatment plans for the same disease to identify which treatment plan had the most encouraging outcome as there are lot of efforts being planned to implement the centralised clinical data repository covering public & private healthcare providers covering primary and secondary care.",
                        "In addition, the several stakeholders, particularly in the insurance community identiﬁed the importance of being able to have access to patient information that can help to guide for the appropriate care. This information, such as the ability of a patient to abide by the prescribed drug regimen or having an adequate support system to provide care upon hospital discharge would be information that will help to ensure that high quality and cost effective care can be set-up and established in the future. Finally, it will be helping to improve the insurance provider experiences.",
                        "On the other hand, there is also a concern that the level of clinical analytics that is necessary will become little complex. As the ﬁeld and parameters evolves, respondents raised the concern that the items that are appropriate for data analysis today will become mainstream and the healthcare industry will have an appetite for more complex questions that we presently don’t have the software and tools to address with accuracy. One example shared was that, it will no longer be concerned that all diabetic patients get two-time HbA1c per year. The industry will instead be focused on more complex clinical measures.",
                        "One of the most important key factor of clinical analytics would be helping the individual providers and the hospitals to submit the research paper with accuracy of data with reference and evidence which could be impossible to generate such report manually by creating the manual data that is too in a large scale. Therefore, clinical analytics would be more demanding which could be adding value to the followings area to hospitals, hcp’s and payers:"

                        "As expected, individuals participating in many researches have identiﬁed several barriers and challenges to being successful in their efforts to data mine effectively. One of the most common problem is the format in which the data exists. This manifests itself in several formats. First, respondents have issues with being able to ﬁnd and manipulate data that exists only in a non-standard format, as this requires extensive data entry and manipulation to yield a satisfactory format in which the data can be analysed.",
                        "Second, just because data is housed electronically entered into the system doesn’t mean that it is ready for analysis. Several respondents indicated that in some instances, data is captured in a free-form method, such as a text note. As such, the information would need to be converted to a discrete, or structured, ﬁeld and parameters for data analysis to take place, by using natural language processing technologies.",
                        "Finally, there are concerns interoperability that some data elements that are required for data analysis are missing because they were captured in an alternate format that is not streamlined into the main data collection tool. For an example of this is lab values that might be captured at an off-site that do not seamlessly transfer to the online system. Hence, this data must be either manually entered or omitted from the overall analysis which will again, not give the complete output while analysing the data.",
                        "Another challenge to being able to easily clinical analytics is ensuring that “apple-to-apple” analysis of the data can be facilitated. For example, being able to understand when studying an order sets where that information begins and where the data ends. Additionally, it is also important to understand what the clinical context of a data point exists in and how does the clinical context impact the data point.",
                        "There are also issues with nomenclature and ensuring that data is captured using the same language and medical coding system across the system and other organisations (i.e. data normalisation and semantic interoperability).",
                        "Clinical analytics works best on a large data sets which is possible when there is EMR/EHR implementation across the group of the hospitals or state and country level covering both private and public hospitals. Most developed countries have already adopted such models, countries in Asia are on the way to take it ahead. Specially in India, the deployment & adoption of EMR by the hospital community is “Nice to Have” component whereas non-clinical /admin & billing application (HIMSS) is “Must Have” components to run their day-to-day business. However, for the past few years, Indian corporate hospitals have started thinking to take this project ahead as they have got the feeling that without technology adoption, it is impossible to improve quality of patient care, patient safety, provider & patient experience. Based on the current study, there are two hospitals across India which has got the HIMSS Stage-6 accreditation which means there is a long way to go to deploy and adopt the clinical application which could be working seamlessly with the integration of HIMSS."

In other words, more than 90% of the hospitals do not allot the budget for their IT spend annually to enable clinical analytics base point EMR/EHR to be implemented. However, nowadays, there are few EMRs available on transaction-based offering to resolve the budget constraint instead of license fee offering. On the other hand, there are few world class EMR available in Open Source community like OSEHRA-VistA, World- VistA and few of the Indian IT companies are working to implement them either by offering on encounter and episode based transaction fee or one time license fee excluding the implementation cost.",

Respondents from both types of organisations agree that cost, efﬁciency, effectiveness and safety need to be the guiding principles of healthcare delivery globally. These organisations have different business models and as such, the key objective of each organisation about the effective use of clinical analytics is somewhat different. Among the respondents from the hospital community, the costs were identiﬁed in the context of being able to deliver quality care, at a cost-effective price. In comparison, in the insurance provider community, respondents were concerned with being able to provide quality care for their constituents, with an eye to cost-effectiveness.",
                        "Clinical analytics can bring huge value to the organisations, yet there are huge hurdles that exist. In order to have effective data to evaluate, healthcare organisations need to consider a number of aspects, including the ability of their software systems to collect the data in a proper format that lend itself to data analysis; the willingness of clinicians to capture clinical information in discrete data ﬁelds and parameters; and the willingness of the healthcare organisation to invest in the analysis of this information, from both the perspective of software and tools, integrated & interoperability.",

                        "Several respondents to this research noted that when the healthcare industry ﬁgures out the answer to some of the simple questions that we are presently asking, such as, does a diabetic patient get the right preventative care at the organisation level local community level and at a later stage it would be state and country level, the questions that would be going to want answers to, are going to be increasingly complex, requiring a higher skill set and more complex analytical tools. An example may be analysing the genetics and proteomics of people to begin to assess the impact of these factors on their conditions and response to treatments or speciﬁc medications.",
                        "Now it is the right time for hospital community to take up the clinical analytics, which is critical for organisations to survive and ﬂourish during changing governmental regulations. Before bringing the analytics, the organisation should begin with EMR deployment having a goal of complete paperless organisation clinically across all the units of the group. It should be integrated with all TPA’s, having feature of electronically data interchange which could be helping to the organisation to complete the clinical work ﬂow during treating the patient then only the clinical analytics will work to get the better and effective outcome to improve the organisation vision & mission."

            "description": "A common problem faced in day-to-day life right from a young age to older age is pain. Most people have arthritis, knee pain, joint pain, or hip joint pain, out of which the most common is knee joint pain. Knee joint pain occurs very commonly right from younger individuals to older individuals. In younger individuals it is common because of sports injuries and accidents. Once people cross 25-40 years, usually it is because of arthritis. Usually when a young patient comes in with knee pain, we take an x-ray of the knee. Most of these young patients have injuries to the ligaments and meniscal injuries in the soft tissue of the knee joints. When it comes to 35-40 year-old females, early arthritis sets in males it is usually at above 50 years. There are different stages of arthritis – initially when a patient comes to the hospital and tells the doctor that they have knee pain, we advise that they take mild painkillers as well as knee exercises, weight reduction, diet control and doing physical workouts to reduce their weight and reduce pressure on the knee joints. But as age progresses, knee joint arthritis keeps increasing. There is no permanent cure for arthritis, the maximum we can do is manage it through medicines. Below is an excerpt from a video interview with Dr BVRN Varma, Chief Orthopaedic surgeon and Joint Replacement surgeon at Omni Visakhapatnam, on questions related to knee surgery and joint replacement.",

                    "answer": ["A: The moment we say surgery, patients say, “Surgery? No sir, we don’t want surgery, we have a lot of doubts about it.” Most patients don’t know what joint replacement surgery is, so they believe the myths about joint replacement surgery. Joint replacement is replacing the bone with a piece of metal. The metal is not just a piece of iron or stainless steel, most of the time we use cobalt-chrome or titanium."]

                    "answer": ["A: In the past, around 20 to 30 years ago, knee implants would last only 5-10 years. Later success rates rose to 10-15 years and now the latest techniques, technologies and new implant designs allow knee implants to last for 20-30 years.",
                "At Omni Visakhapatnam, we have a good counselling session for each and every patient who has knee pain, who is above the age of 45 years, in stage 3 and having difficulty while walking. Basically in stage 3 we tell patients to go for surgery."]

                    "answer": ["A: Yes, patients can undergo surgery for both knees at a time, depending on their age. Usually age factors, cardiac status, lung status, kidney status are all taken into consideration. If the patient is at high risk because of comorbid status like high diabetes, high hypertension, or if cardiac surgery was done, we tell the patient to do them one after the other. Usually if a surgery is done on Monday you can go back on Friday, within 5 to 6 days or 2-3 months after, so that you can reduce the amount of risk of the surgery to the patient."]

                    "answer": ["A: There are a lot of misconceptions about surgery. If a procedure is done in the morning, after 24 hours we will mobilize the patient with a stand or a walker along with our physiotherapy and consultants. Physiotherapy is started a day after the surgery and the patient can walk for 3-4 weeks after surgery with support. They can then gradually remove the support and then get back to their usual routine.",
                "Climbing of staircases can be done after 6-8 weeks and they can go back to routine work after 2-3 months. Some patients may be able to go back after just 4 weeks. They can even start going on journeys after 3-4 months provided they have been doing physiotherapy. Routine movements of the knee joint should have been achieved after physiotherapy."]

                    "answer": ["A: Most patients will experience knee pain after surgery. The pain is because of a problem with the bone, it is not because of the surgery. Bone pain is because of osteoporosis. There is a lot of difference between knee osteoporosis and knee osteoarthritis. Knee osteoporosis is weakening of the bone because of calcium reduction in the bone, while knee osteoarthritis is the erosion of knee cartilage in the bone.",
                "So when we replace the knee joint we try to achieve a 90-95 percent success rate. But still a few patients may complain about pain. The pain is because of osteoporosis, so the best thing to do is to be fit, manage your diet, take proper calcium supplements, do knee exercises and go for a walk. Once you reduce your weight everything will start coming back to normal."]

                    "answer": ["A: Depending on your age, if you’ve had an injury or because of severe arthritis or moderate arthritis, soft tissue structures will get damaged. So immediately after waking up, mobilize your knee joints for 5-10 minutes. Stand for 1-2 minutes, tighten your knees and then start walking. That might reduce your pain. Take the help of a physiotherapist to reduce your knee locking system."]

                    "quetion": "Q. What is the age limit for surgery?",
                    "answer": ["A: The age limit for surgery depends on the condition of the patient. Now rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis is a genetic condition that involves entire joints, your bones, your ligaments, your neck and spine. It usually occurs in the younger age. So younger people can have knee replacement if they are suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and have difficulty in walking. But osteoarthritis usually starts after 45 years, most of the patients have severe stage 3 or stage 4 arthritis. The usual age for the latter is 45 years for Indian females and 52-55 years for Indian males.",
                "Above the age of 70 years also, a patient can undergo surgery. But this depends on their cardiac status, their physical fitness and their pain threshold. Before having surgery, the patient needs good counselling from the consultant who will be performing the surgery.",
                "Most people after the age of 70, when knee pain occurs because of imbalance or because of any other problems, it is better to use a stick while walking. If they are confident it is okay, if they are not confident using support, it is usually better for a patient above 70 to 75 years. There are patients who can walk at 80 years. Usually male patients are above 60 to 65 and female patients around 45-50 years."]

                    "quetion": "Q. What special care should I take after surgery?",
                    "answer": ["A: When they are in the hospital, patients will have lots of physical activity within the hospital. Our consultants and junior consultants will take care of that in the morning and evening. Once they go back home, it is very important that a physiotherapist is there with them for 2-3 weeks. If a physiotherapist is with them, the results of a knee replacement surgery after knee replacement will be very high – usually around 90-95 percent.",
                "If you don’t do physiotherapy, the success rate will come down. So after surgery, some patients may require therapy for 2-3 weeks, some may require it for 3-4 weeks. It varies from individual to individual. After waking up in the morning, you should do knee exercises for 5 to 10 minutes. The physiotherapist will teach you those exercises. After getting up from the bed, stand for one minute and prepare your body, then start walking."]

                    "quetion": "Q. What should I expect after surgery?",
                    "answer": ["A: After surgery, some patients will have complications, with the most common one being pain. Pain usually is because of osteoporosis or because of the incision that is made in the skin. The skin may take some time to come back to normal. For osteoporosis, the patient should keep taking calcium supplements.",
                "Some patients may experience swelling. This is natural and will take 2-4 weeks to subside. Some patients may still have swelling even after 6 weeks along with a fever. If this is the case they should come back to the consultant and get a blood test done and check for infection. For most knee replacement surgeries, infection is common in only one percent of patients.",
                "Because of severe osteoporosis, some patients will have an implant problem because of loosening of the implant. So before the surgery, a patient should first check whether or not they can have surgery and whether the knee can be replaced. The weight of the implant has to borne by the bone so it has to be tested whether or not the bone can withstand the implant."]

                    "answer": ["A: Some patients come to us saying that they have had orthopedic treatment but have no relief. They come back with the same symptoms as before. Most of the complications they have are pain, infection and implant failure. Implant failure is when the implant becomes very weak, or the patient might fall and sustain a fracture in the knee joint. So again, once the infection is gone we will do culture and blood tests. If it is a mild infection it is okay but if it is very severe, fluid should be aspirated and culture should be done to find out what kind of infection is there."]

                    "answer": ["A: The most dreaded complication of knee replacement surgery is infection, but this rate is usually just one percent. Because if you have a proper operation, operation theater, preoperative evaluation, the chances of infection can be minimized to 100 percent.",
                "The second complication is if the patient is really old, around 70 to 80 years, it is better to continue their support after knee replacement for at least 6 to 8 weeks until they are confident that they can walk without support. If not, if they fall down, they may sustain a fracture."]

                    "answer": ["A: Before jogging or walking, you should do warm up exercises to prepare the knee joints, spine and muscles to walk or jog. Most people directly go jogging or walking and come back knee or calf pain."]

                    "answer": ["A: The success rate of knee replacement surgery is usually 90-95 percent. The remaining five to ten percent represents problems that the patient may have before surgery, or in some cases postoperative problems if proper precautions are not taken preoperatively. The patient may experience cardiac problems, kidney problems or infections. Nowadays a lot of implant designs are available in the market, which can be implanted into the knee joint and have a survival rate of up to 20 to 30 years. Earlier implants would last only 10 to 15 years."]

                    "answer": ["A: Partial knee replacement surgery can be done with a select number of patients in stage 2 and stage 3, if the medial compartment is really damaged and if the lateral compartment is good. The problem with partial knee replacement surgery is, if it fails, total knee replacement surgery will have to be done. So in our Indian scenario, we try to avoid partial knee replacement.",
                "Total knee replacement surgery is far better than partial knee replacement surgery. Partial knee replacement surgery cannot be done if the patient does not have good bone quality."]

                        "On 10th August’15, Dr. Kishore B.Reddy, Head of Musculoskeletal Oncology, at Omni Hospitals, performed a cutting-edge, limb-sparing cancer surgery on a 28 year-old female patient by name Jyothi. She is suffering from Osteosarcoma of her Right Thy Bone, a form of cancer that affects bone around joints in the arms and legs. During her 6 months bout with the disease, she eventually lost her ability to walk as the tumor, which grew in size, caused great pain and even broke the bone.",
                "Before visiting Dr. Kishore B. Reddy at Omni Hospitals, she visited many other premier cancer centers in India, all of which recommended amputation at the hip as the only cure. She was recommended to see Dr. Kishore B. Reddy for limb salvage by Dr. Murali Krishna, MGM Cancer Hospital, Vizag.   Determined to find a way to save her leg, she sought opinion of Dr. Kishore B. Reddy at Hyderabad. After examination, Dr. Kishore B. Reddy presented Mrs. Jyothi with the opportunity to save her leg by performing a specialized procedure called a whole Excision with Mega prosthesis Reconstruction at Omni RK Hospital, Vizag.",
                "During the procedure, which lasted 6 hours and was performed in state of art theatre at Omni RK Hospital, Vizag, Dr. Kishore B. Reddy, successfully excised a massive tumor and reconstructed Mrs. Jyothi’s femur bone with metallic Implant. Following the procedure, Mrs. Jyothi can now walk on her own and will be able to resume normal daily activities soon. “This case represents a very successful outcome. Patients with Osteosarcoma deserve to have the option of a cure that does not involve amputation,” Dr. Kishore B. Reddy remarked upon finishing surgery.",
                "To perform such a unique procedure, Dr. Kishore B. Reddy completed his surgical training at TATA Memorial Hospital in Mumbai and went on to complete advanced training in Musculoskeletal Oncology and Tissue Banking at National University Hospital in Singapore, a one-thousand-bedded hospital recognized internationally for its excellence in many fields. Currently, there are approximately 10 surgical oncologists with special focus on orthopedics in all of India. Of them, only Dr. Kishore B. Reddy practices at Omni Hospitals in Andhra Pradesh & Telangana. After returning from Singapore in past 6 years he has done more than 1000 cases of Limb Salvage surgeries and has special interest in Pelvic Reconstruction surgeries.",
                "“Cancers of the bone and soft tissues are not as common as other cancers, but they deserve special attention for many reasons. First, while they can affect adults, they very commonly affect young people, children or teenagers. Second, because very few centers have the expertise to deal with them, they often result in debilitating amputations that often are not necessary,” commented Dr. Kishore B. Reddy.   He then added, “As a nation, we need more doctors with specialized training so that patients affected by diseases like Osteosarcoma have access to the latest global standards, which include options for a cure besides amputation.”",
                "It is of great privilege to have a Surgeon like Dr. Kishore B. Reddy to come to Vizag and render his services to our patients in Omni RK Hospitals Vizag."
